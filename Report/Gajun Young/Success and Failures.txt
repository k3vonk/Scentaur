4. Successes and Failures

4.1 Team Learning outcomes.

Producing Scentaur was not an easy feat. It required many solid hours of work shared amongst
all our team members. Every individual in the team had their own unique experience and 
their own learning outcomes however, collectively we understood that delegation of work
was key to the success of Scentaur.

In order for Scentaur to progress the team had to work at a quick pace but also develop things
that can connect with other components that other team members have created. i.e. for the
server to display any sort of smells, at least one smell had to be created first. And for
statistics to be created we must be able to gather all the smell information.
This gave insight to the team members of Scentaur to understand what dependencies and components
require more attention than others.

The Scentaur team learned that great communication goes a long way in helping others on the team
to understand the different components. In order for the usage of the abuser class a brief
comment description and a sample was required to show the idea of how the abuser class worked.
Similarly, members had to discuss how to import different packages to set up the server on their 
own local machine. Without communication the team wouldn't have progressed as far as it has today.

Another learning outcome was the overall coding and learning outside libraries. The team
had a research phase to decide what libraries would suit Scentaur and from that conclusion
one of the major libraries was JavaParser. We had to hold team meetings to discuss and understand
how JavaParser work so everyone was on board. Thus enabling team bonding.

With that there are so many components that the team experienced throughout the building up of Scentaur.
The ability to lead specific components, to voice your opinion and suggestions within the group, and many more
unique learning outcomes that each individual gained.
