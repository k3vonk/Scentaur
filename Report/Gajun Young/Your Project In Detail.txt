================ Your Project In Detail =====================

Applying Scentaur's detection tool onto itself provides a great sample for 
the team to understand the problems Scentaur may experience as a software. 
Along with the ability to help team members to strengthen their coding 
style especially in Java. The following is a worked example of Scentaur:

----------

After the server is switched on, it is possible to host the web server on our 
local machine. To obtain a more impressive view of the web page, it is ideal to
run localhost on your selective browser. In our case, we will be running on 
Google Chrome. When you first open the page, the user is met with a simplistic, modern,
and minimal style landing page. Where the user is requested to send a zip folder to 
the server either through "Drag-and-Drop" or click on the link and search the zip file
from one of your own directory. 

------------

Once the user has drag and dropped, the user then has to click on the update button to
request the next action. This action will send the user to the detailed page. The detail
page contains many information about the users zip file. The back-end handles the zip file
by decompressing the information inside and take out all the relevant Java files.
It is clearly visible on the left hand side and a tab bar on the top that Scentaur is capable
of reading in Java files and displaying the original files back out to the user.

-------------

On the right hand side, the overview displays the different figures statistical based. 
It is not visually appealing however, it nails down numbers straight to the users.
Along with this text of statistics comes with statistical charts. These different charts
represent the type of smell that Scentaur has. 

-------------


The user is then enabled to check the type of smell categories on the topic for specific classes.
In this sample below, I can choose the x.java class and find bloaters and dispensables.
Immediately on the right provides snippets of code where the smell occured. 
Each snippet is accompanied by the file name, smell type and the line at which it was detected.
We use this to map the smell to the line number of the original file.

Scentaur enables us to do this for infinite numbers of times searching through a combinations of smells.
